### Networking and Protocols
##### What is a network protocol?
A network protocol is a set of rules in which dictates how computers communicate on the network. Without these standards, communication can get confusing or will not work at all. Protocols determine the order of actions to take when computers communicate with each other. 
##### Protocol Stacks and Purposes of Protocols
- Standardise the format of communication
- Specify the order and timing of communication
- Allow all parties to determine the meaning of a communication

Communication is only successful when all parties agree on using the same protocol. This agreement is not limited to using that one protocol, rather they are agreeing to a set of protocols to use in communication. Consider the example below:
![Wireshark-Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cacaocat-syr/cacaocat-syr.github.io/master/Images/Networking-WiresharkSample.png)This screenshot shows a sample of a VoIP communication using multiple protocols. Computers must agree on a set of protocols to use for communication since each protocol performs different tasks. These determined sets of protocols are referred to as a protocol stack - where each layer receives a service from the layer below it and provides service for the layer above it.
##### OSI Model

The above diagram, the OSI model, is one way to represent a protocol stack. This model divides the protocol stack into 7 layers of communication. When we talk about protocols and what layer it operates at, the OSI model is utilized. 

1. Physical - "Is it plugged in?" This layer focuses on the physical aspect of communication involving but not limited to: wires, cables, radio waves, fiber optic, and hardware.
2. Data Link - "Can you see the other person's MAC address?" This layer handles MAC addressing and switches. It connects the physical part of the network to the abstract part (packets and data)
3. Network - "Can you ping that IP address?" This layer handles packets, routers, and network addressing. It handles how the packet will be routed.
4. Transport - "Is it TCP or UDP?" Transport prepares your data to be transmitted, ensures reliable connectivity, and packet sequencing.
5. Session - "Are you still logged in?" This handles your connections between systems. It negotiates the connection and maintains it.
6. Presentation - "How is that data displayed?" Data that is sent from one end to another should be received in a format that is useful to the receiver. Some of the responsibilities of the presentation layer are: encryption/decryption, graphics, data compression, character / string conversion
7. Application - "What application or program are you using?" This layer is the only one that the user interacts with directly. It also determines what network services are required. Is this mail? Is this a file transfer? 

##### TCP/IP Model 
![TCP/IP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cacaocat-syr/cacaocat-syr.github.io/master/Images/Networking-TCPIP.png)When we implement the protocols we use the TCP/IP protocol. The TCP/IP has four layers: Network, Internet, Transport, and Application. In comparison to the OSI model, each layer has to do more work. The network layer combines both the Physical and Data Link layer. The Application layer comprises the session, presentation, and application layer in OSI. No matter what model you use, the functionality of how data is transferred does not change. 

##### How Protocol Stacks Communicate
![Protocol-Stack-Comms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cacaocat-syr/cacaocat-syr.github.io/master/Images/Network-protocolstackcomms.png)
Although the image above doesn't show all the layers, the basic idea is the same. As data is transferred from one host to another, data is "encapsulated" as it goes down each layer. To be more clear, data is added when it traverses down. The application layer passes down data towards the transport layer where a TCP Header is added. The Transport layer passes it down to the internet layer adding another header call the IP header. Then it gets passed down to the Network layer where the Ethernet header is added becoming a frame. 
As data is passed to the receiver, it goes through "de-encapsulation" where each of those headers are removed.
