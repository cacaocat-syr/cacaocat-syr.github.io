### Python: Date and time format

Working with dates can be incredibly useful. Maybe you want to run a script that outputs results to a new file every few hours, but you want to keep these results separate and have different names. Using the ```datetime``` module you can create a new file each time a python script is executed by having the date and time in the filename. 

```
from datetime import date, datetime

today = date.today()
now = datetime.now()

print("Today's Date Format is: " + today.strftime("%m%d%Y") + now.strftime("_%H%M%S") )
```
The above script imports ```date```, and ```datetime``` from the ```datetime``` module. It saves the current date and current time in separate variables.

Using the ```.strftime()``` function, it formats the time using format codes to output the current date and current time in our desired format. More information on ```.strftime()``` format codes here: https://strftime.org/

Output:
```
Today's Date Format is: 03132020_215102
```
So what about utilizing this trick in filenames? You can concatenate strings together when creating a file. Lets say you have generated some results from your script and at the end you want to print it all to a file that has the full month name and day of the month in the filename.
```
def lets_print():
  with open("results" + datetime.now().strftime() + ".txt", "a+") as out:
    ...
```
So lets look at the strftime chart. For full month name we will want ```%B``` and for day of month we will want ```%d```.
```
def lets_print():
  with open("results" + datetime.now().strftime("%B %d") + ".txt", "a+") as out:
    ...
```
If we run this it may throw an error because the entire datetime part is not a string. To force this to be a string use ```str()```.
```
def lets_print():
  with open("results" + str(datetime.now().strftime("%B %d")) + ".txt", "a+") as out:
    ...
```
