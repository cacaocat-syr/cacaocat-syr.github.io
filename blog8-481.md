### Networking and Protocols (continued)

##### IPv4 vs IPv6
There are two different versions if Internet Protocol. IPv4 was created only having academia and research in mind. It was never intended to be used world-wide and there became a short of available IP addresses to handle all the devices as IPv4 only had 4.2 billion unique addresses available. IPv6 was created in response to this shortage and allowed 340 undecillion addresses as well as implemented more features. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled in every modern operating system.

|IPv4  |IPv6  |
|--|--|
|32-bit address  |128-bit address  |
|4.2 billion addresses | 340 undecillion addresses |
|No authentication | Provides authentication of endpoints|
|Encryption provided by application|Support for encryption in protocol|
|Best effort transport |Quality of Service features provided in protocol|

##### IPv4 Packet Header

Above is a diagram of how a IPv4 packet header is laid out. Each line of the header is 4 bytes or 32 bits (0-31 bit #)
IPv4 headers) should always be a value of 5 (5 * 4 bytes = 20 bytes total). Anything more than 20 bytes means that options are enabled. The option field can be any length but of multiples of 4 bytes. Some options are:

- record route: tells a router to add its IP address to the options field
- IP timestamp: tells a router to write a timestamp into the options field
- strict source routing: allows the sender to specify the exact route a packet should take to the destination
- loose source routing: allows the sender to give a list of routers a packet must pass through. It may also use other routers if required.

As you can see the above options are actions usually carried out by routers. Although these options can have valid uses, it is rarely used for legitimate traffic. These options can be used for malicious practices.

 IPv4 Header Key Fields:

- IP Version field: 4 bits, internet protocol version used to create the packet --  4 or 6
- IHL field: Internet Header Length; tells the length of the packet in multiples of 4 bytes.
- Protocol field: 8 bits, integer denoting what type of IP message encapsulation is used.
- TTL field: 8 bits, specifies how many hops a packet is allows to take before dest. If 0, dropped.
- Fragmentation field: tells sender where this fragment packet is in relation to the original large packet
- SRC/DEST Addr field: contains IP Addr of sender and IP Addr of recipient

##### IPv6 Header

IPv6 removes obsolete options that were available in IPv4. The above diagram is the layout of an IPv6 header. IPv6 headers have a fixed length of 40 bytes. IPv6 extends the space needed to specify source and destination addresses as well as implements new features. With this version of IP, it is possible to use MAC addresses as IP addresses. IP addresses can be configured manually based on the local MAC address and information from the network's default gateway.

IPv6 Key Fields:

- Version: same as IPv4, the version field specifies the version of the packet
- Traffic Class field: 1 byte/8 bit; specifies priority of packet for QoS
- Flow Label field: 20 bits; used for QoS mgmt conveying special handling functions for packet
- Payload Length field: 2 byte/16 bit; specifies length of packet in quantity of bytes
- Next Header field: 1 byte/8 bit; specfies next encaps. Protocol in the payload of packet.
- Hop Limit field: 1 byte/8 bit; prevents routing loops by decrementing hop limit val at each router. (TTL)
- SRC/DEST Addr field: byte/128 bit; contains IP Addr of sender / receiver
