### Python: List Comprehensions

List Comprehensions are used to create a new list from an existing list. List Comprehensions consist of brackets containing *an expression* followed by a **for** clause then possibly followed by multiple **for** or **if** statements. The *expression* is the object that you want to extract from an existing list.

Syntax:
```
new_list = [expression(x) for x in originial_list ...(for ... | if ...)]
```
List Comprehensions work as an alternative to using for loops to loop through a list. For example:
```
List1 = [...]
List2 = []
for x in List1:
	if (condition):
		List2.append(expression(x))
```
can be replaced with...
```
List1 = [...]
List2 = [expression(x) for x in List1 if (condition)]
```
Below is a colored example of above to make it easier to see how it is structured.

In terms of time, List Comprehensions are slightly faster than nested for loops and if statements. You can test this using the datetime module and calculating the time difference.
Despite List Comprehensions being faster than loops, it is generally not best practice if your List Comprehension is too long of a statement itself.
```
list = [x for row in list2 if row in y for x in row ............]
```
It can become to confusing for a human to read. Code should be human friendly.

Another thing to note is that List Comprehensions cannot append to an existing list. Instead it will overwrite the original contents if you reference an existing list.
