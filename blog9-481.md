### Network Device Security: Sniffing

##### What is a Sniffer?

A sniffer is a program or device that monitors data traveling over a network. It can be used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes. Before the creation of switches, it was easy to sniff packets due to hubs forwarding those packets to every device connected to it. Hubs replicate traffic to all ports and it was up to the receiving devices to determine if the packet was destined for them. For a sniffer to see packets, they have to arrive on the network interface of the host running the sniffer which, with a hub, makes it easier to sniff all packets being transferred on a network.

By default, hosts are selective. Sniffers can use the network interface's promiscuous mode to accept all frames being received including those intended for other hosts. 

##### How are Switches a solution to sniffing?

Switches combine the functionality of a hub and a bridge (a device that maintains track of network addresses, segments traffic, breaks up collision domains). They forward data to hosts like hubs, but instead of broadcasting data to all hosts, it only forwards data to the destined MAC Address. MAC addresses are unique identifiers for each network interface card installed on a host. Switches are able to analyse the frame being sent and determines who it should be sent to by maintaining a directory of ports to MAC addresses. By monitoring and controlling traffic, it minimises collisions and sniffing becomes ineffective. A sniffer on a switched network only sees traffic meant for the host that the sniffer is running on. Promiscuous mode has no effect here.

Sniffing is not impossible though. It is still possible to sniff traffic by impersonating a local router.

##### Sniffing for ... Good?

Although sniffing is often used for attackers to gain information, it also allows insight into what an attacker can see. Sniffers can be used as tools for system administrators, but it can also be used against them.

Sniffers provide visibility into what is happening on a network, which is useful for both troubleshooting problems and analysing security issues. Sniffers can be hardware devices that physically attach to the network, but are more commonly software running on a host. Different sniffers are designed for different purposes. Some are bundled with rootkits, some give detailed analysis, and some are combined with intrusion detection systems. 

*Authorised Sniffing* - most switches support features that allow network admins to perform authorised sniffing to monitor LAN traffic.
*Unauthorised Sniffing* - tools have been improved over time to make sniffing possible despite switches being in place. Attackers are able to abuse the ARP protocol to establish a Man-in-the-Middle attack by impersonating a router to capture traffic.


##### Examples of Sniffers

- tcpdump: initial triage
- WireShark: detailed analysis  and packet decoding
- Snort: Network intrusion detection system to determine scope of compromise
- dsniff: useful for sniffing on a switch
