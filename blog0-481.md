### Oracle SQL Developer: Removing leading and trailing characters

There may be times where you may have imported a new table into your database without selecting enclosures and now all your data is surrounded by unwanted characters.

Consider the below situation for example:
```
		Students
|-----------------------------------------------|
|_____Names_____|____Gender_____|___Fav Color___|
|"Fredrick"	|	"M"	|"Red"		|
|"Jennifer"	|	"F"	|"Purple"	|
|"Mark"		|	"M"	|"Black"	|
-------------------------------------------------

```
All your data in the table is enclosed by quotes and this may come into conflict when you have to manipulate that data. This blog will focus on how to remove quotes for Oracle SQL users.
Since this task involves having to update the table, you will need to start you SQL query with the ```UPDATE``` command followed by the table name.
```
UPDATE Students;
```
The ```SET``` command is used with ```UPDATE``` to select what columns and values will be changed in the table. We will start with leading characters first. 
```
UPDATE Students
SET Names;
```
Using ```SET``` we want to only keep the string value that does not start with a quote. So we will need the SUBSTRING() function. For Oracle, this function is actually called SUBSTR() instead. Its syntax is ```SUBSTR( string, start_position , [length ] )```.
```
UPDATE Students
SET Names = SUBSTR(Names, 2, LENGTH(Names));
```
SUBSTR() function will take the Names values, start at the second position of each value and then continue until the end of the value. But what if some of the values do not start with an unwanted character? We would be removing a character that we may actually need. So we want to focus on the rows that only start with that unwanted character ```"```. We will use the ```WHERE``` command.
```
UPDATE Students
SET Names = SUBSTR(Names, 2, LENGTH(Names))
WHERE SUBSTR(Names,1,1) = '"';
```
Here we used the SUBSTR() function again. This command takes the Names values, starts at position 1 and ends at position 1. Then it checks if that substring is a ```"```.

Overall, this command ```UPDATE```s the Students table, ```SET```s the Name values to its substring to begin on its second character only if the first character begins with a ```"```.

Now the table should look like this.
```
		Students
|-----------------------------------------------|
|_____Names_____|____Gender_____|___Fav Color___|
|Fredrick"	|	"M"	|"Red"		|
|Jennifer"	|	"F"	|"Purple"	|
|Mark"		|	"M"	|"Black"	|
-------------------------------------------------

```
We want to do the same for the trailing character. We will need to use the same functions and commands, but alter it to target and omit the last character instead. We will start with this:
```
UPDATE Students
SET Names = SUBSTR(Names, ,)
WHERE SUBSTR(Names, ) = '"';
```
We want to ```SET``` our value to start at position 1 and end 1 position before the last character. We will need to use the LENGTH() function again.
```
UPDATE Students
SET Names = SUBSTR(Names, 1, LENGTH(Names)-1)
WHERE SUBSTR(Names, ) = '"';
```
Now we want to target the rows that only end in ```"```. With the SUBSTR() function, it can take negative values to refer going backwards in positions of a string. In this case we only want to go backward one position.
```
UPDATE Students
SET Names = SUBSTR(Names, 1, LENGTH(Names)-1)
WHERE SUBSTR(Names, -1) = '"';
```
Running this Query should give you this:
```
		Students
|-----------------------------------------------|
|_____Names_____|____Gender_____|___Fav Color___|
|Fredrick	|	"M"	|"Red"		|
|Jennifer	|	"F"	|"Purple"	|
|Mark		|	"M"	|"Black"	|
-------------------------------------------------
```
And now you know how to remove leading and trailing characters from your data.


#### Reference
Removing Leading Characters:
```
UPDATE my_table
SET field_column = substr(field_column, 2, LENGTH(field_column))
WHERE substr(field_column, 1, 1) = '"';
```

Removing Trailing Characters:
```
UPDATE my_table
SET field_column = SUBSTR(field_column, 1, LENGTH(field_column)-1)
WHERE substr(field_column, -1) = '"';
```
