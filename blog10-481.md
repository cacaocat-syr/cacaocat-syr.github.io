### Securing Wireless Networks: IEEE802.11

##### 802.11 Standards
What is 802.11? It refers to part 11 of the 802 standards that were created by IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. 802 standards define the set of rules in which we create Local Area Networks (LAN) and Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN). Part 11 defines the set of standards in which we create Wireless LANs.

802.11 is a collection of amendments that were created to add changes and improvements to wireless capabilities. Improvements to the wireless networks usually focused on performance, reliability, and range, bandwidth, and security.

##### 802.11 Amendments
###### 802.11b

802.11b supported radio frequencies in the 2.4GHz range and maximum theoretical bandwidth of 11 Mbps. Due to other radio frequencies interfering, 11 Mbps was just a theoretical number, not the actual speed

###### 802.11a
802.11a supported 5GHz frequency range only with a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 54 Mbps.

###### 802.11 g
Supported 2.4 GHz frequency range with maximum theoretical bandwidth of 54 Mbps.

###### 802.11n
Compared to the above amendments, 802.11n brought the real possibility of better performance and range. The biggest improvement was that it initially allowed a bandwidth of 100 Mbps and later allowed 600 Mbps. It supported both 2.4 and 5 GHz range. It allows for more devices to connect to a single access point through a technique called Multiple Input Multiple Output.
###### 802.11ac 
It is the most recent approved amendment that allows an aggregated bandwidth of 1 Gbps for a multilink scenario(some implementations allowed up to 6.77 Gbps), but only supported 5GHz frequency range. This meant that 802.11ac allowed for faster speeds, but at a shorter distance. For devices that ran at 2.4 GHz, they had to use 802.11n. 802.11ac focused on the goal of "always on, always connected, and always communicating".
###### 802.11ax
802.11ax is still in progress and has not been ratified yet. They have mentioned that there are possibilities for support of aggregated bandwidth of 11 Gbps and that it will support range frequencies below 6GHz. 802.11ax was made with IoT in mind. 
###### 802.11i
802.11i is the only amendment that focused on Wireless Security. It focused on improved encryption for networks such as WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3.

##### WiFi Generational Names
The WiFi Alliance created a new naming scheme to talk about newer amendments for 802.11 as it eventually became confusing.  Previous amendments were not included.

- WiFi 6: 802.11ax
- WiFi 5: 802.11ac
- WiFi 4: 802.11n
