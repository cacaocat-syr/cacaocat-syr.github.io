### Defense in Depth

When it comes to security, there is no single solution to solve all problems. It is important to implement layers of security measures to ensure that your systems and networks are protected from attackers. If one defense system fails, there should be other systems in place. Prevention is ideal, but detection is a must. Detection has no value without response. 

Technology constantly evolves much faster than we can secure it. With newer technology comes more risks. Risk can be quantified with the equation below:
```
Risk = Threat X Vulnerabilities
```
Risk is the probability of a threat crossing or meeting with a vulnerability. It is impossible to eliminate all risk. Risk is always present. The purpose of security is to constantly track, manage, mitigate, accept, and/or transfer risk.

Security is about controlling and protecting our critical assets. We want to think about protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of our assets. 

 - Confidentiality: Only authorized people or organizations are allowed to view and handle certain data
 - Integrity: Our data is authentic, accurate, trustworthy, and not tampered with
 - Availability: Our assets are accessible when needed.

#### Four Difference Approaches to Defense in Depth (DiD)

There are four basic approaches for Defense in Depth that help reduce, accept, or transfer risk. These approaches ensure security that if one countermeasure fails, there are more behind it. 

##### Uniform Protection

Uniform Protection is the most common approach to Defense in Depth. All systems are treated the same and each receive equal protection. This involves using firewalls, VPN, intrusion detection systems, anti-malware software, and patching. 
No specific systems are given more protection over others. This approach can be more vulnerable to threats and malicious insiders since systems are not separated or categorized within the network. Uniform Protection can be considered the weakest approach, but good to start with. 

##### Protected Enclaves 

Protected Enclaves approach involves segmenting critical systems and data from the rest of your network. This can be done using several VLANs, firewalls, switches, or even just physically separating critical systems and data from others. Segmentation can also involve segmenting non-sensitive systems like desktops, public services, etc. Doing this can help minimize risk if the network were to be attacked.
Network Access Control Lists on routers and switches help manage the flow of traffic inbound and outbound. They determine which are allowed and which are blocked.

##### Information Centric

Information Centric focuses on protecting the organization's data from harm. It involved identifying where your sensitive data is located and then adding security layers on top of it.

Data is accessed by applications.  Applications are residing on hosts. Hosts are on the network. 

##### Vector-Oriented

Vector-Oriented approach stops threats at vectors. Identifying vectors at where threats can enter is one way of securing and preventing attacks.
