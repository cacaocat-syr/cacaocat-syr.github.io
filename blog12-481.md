### Access Control 

##### Data Classification

It is impossible to protect all of your organization's data. When it comes to handling risks, sometimes you have to prioritise some over others. It is the same with systems, processes, tasks, vulnerabilities, and yes even data. 

Easiest way to classify your data is ask: if this data is leaked to the public, how much of an impact would it have on your organisation and/or its customers? You also want to consider if this information is public or private.

Public information is low priority. Because anyone can find this information and it is (presumably) information that won't harm the organisation or customers, you won't need to take action to protect it (or at least very little action). All other data needs to be protected at some level. These levels reflect sensitivity and potential impact. Some organisations have a yes/no data classification system while others, such as the government, have a more complex system of several levels. For example, some of the government classification levels are:

- Top Secret: Highest level of protection are given to data labelled this and exposure is critical
- Secret: this data is important and exposure could bring harm
- Confidential: this data is important  and exposure could be detrimental
- Unclassified: it is preferred to not release this information but the nation would not be harmed if it were

Applying levels of classification helps the organisation focus on putting more protection on some data over others. In terms of how these levels of protection would impact the organisation's functionality, there must be controls put in place that would prevent unauthorised personnel from accessing sensitive data.

##### Access Control 

You want to be able to identify who is access this data against who should be able to access this data.  *Identification* is the process of claiming to be someone. Identification is not enough to prove who you say you are. Users have to *authenticate*, meaning they have to prove who they say they are. There are other factors that should be considered when it comes to access control:

- **Something you know**: a piece of information that only you should know such as a password
- **Something you have**: possessing something, such as a token (a one-time password that is generated)
- **Something you are**: your physicality, such as biometrics (retina, fingerprints)
- **Some place that you are**: your geographic area using GPS

After you are authenticated, you have to be *authorised* to access data. Are you allowed to access it? Authorisation should be based on the rule of least privilege. Only give enough access for someone to be able to do their job function and that's it.

Lastly, you have to keep track of *accountability*. You have to keep records of who did what and when.

###### Controlling Access

There are some principles that need to be followed when giving someone access. There is the first principle that we mentioned above and that is *least privilege*. When giving access, you should only give the minimum amount of access to be able to let them do their job and nothing more. 

If they temporarily need access to something else, we want to consider our second principle of *need to know*. Give them the access only when they need it and revoke that access when they are done.

The third principle is *separation of duties*. When it comes to assigning tasks, you should break that task down into subtasks and assign those subtasks to different people. This is to prevent individuals from having too much power and access.

There is also the risk of someone getting too familiar with their positions. *Rotation of duties* prevents people from colluding and going against the organisation.
