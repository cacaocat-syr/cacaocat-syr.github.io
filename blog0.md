### Lab A - Intro to Docker  

After getting docker installed on Windows, I was having trouble pulling the hello world image.

After some googling initially I thought I had to create a docker account and do 'docker login'. I found this particularly interesting after I logged in:

After doing that I tried the pull again, but I realised that I was having the same issue. I then noticed I had made a stupid typo and that the image name was "hello-world" not "hello world".
