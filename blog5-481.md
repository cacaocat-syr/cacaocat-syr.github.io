### Python: How to Print
Yes I know. This is something basic that everyone should know, but what isn't mentioned is that there are different ways of controlling your print statements than just simply saying ```print(this)```. Some of which you may or may not already know. 

##### Concatenation
You can concatenate multiple strings and variables on one line and print it.
```
A = "Hello"
B = " World"
print(A + B + ".")
```
Output:
```
Hello World.
```
##### Sep=" "
You can use the ```sep``` variable to control the format of how variables are printed. If you want to print multiple variables, but separate them by a certain character ```sep`` is what you are looking for.
```
A = "Apple"
B = "Orange"
C = "Cherry"
print(A, B, C, sep=",")
```
Output:
```
Apple,Orange,Cherry
```
```sep``` can also be combined with the concatenation method.
##### Printing to a file
```Sep``` isn't the only variable you can use. There is also the ```File``` variable. You can use this to print to a specified file.
```
with open("A.txt", "a+") as o_file:
	print("this is a file", file=o_file)
```
This will print "this is a file" to a file called "A.txt".
##### End=" "
There may be times where you might want to print a line without a newline character. ```end=""``` is what you are looking for. Just like ```sep=""``` you can specify how you want to control your print, but with ```end=""``` it controls how your print statements are ended. By default, the ending character is newline.
```
print("This is my first sentence. ", end="")
print("This is my second sentence.")
```
Output:
```
This is my first sentence. This is my second sentence.
```
