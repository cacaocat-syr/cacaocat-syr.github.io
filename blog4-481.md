### Python: Introduction to Dictionaries
In Python, you might have utilized Lists or Variables a lot in your code or if you are more of a Java person, you have used arrays or multidimensional arrays. Arrays (and multidimensional arrays) aren't available in Python which is why lists are used often. But what if you are working with data that has multiple rows and columns? Consider the data below for example.

Sure you can use nested lists, but that can get messy at times. In this post we are going to be using dictionaries to store our data. 

First we will want to be reading our file first.
```
import csv

def read_from_file(file):
	with open(file, "r") as csv_file:
	csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')

datafile="./emailList.csv"  
emailUID=file_to_dict(datafile)
```
Now that we have our base script to read the .csv file, we can now have its contents to be input into a dictionary. **Dictionaries** are data structures that store data as a Key-Value pair similar to an actual dictionary where you have Term-Definition. 

Our example will pair emails to UID numbers. To initiate a empty dictionary you can use:
```
tempdict = {}
```
Now when it comes to appending to dictionaries, there isn't an explicitly defined way to do so. If you want to append a new key-value pair to a dictionary you can do this:
```
tempdict[key] = value
```
.. and this will add that new key-value pair to the existing dictionary ```tempdict```.
Now that we know how to  make an empty dictionary and how to add to one lets put that information to use. Lets add those new lines to our existing script.
```
def file_to_dict(file):  
    with open(file, "r") as csv_file:  
        csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')  
        tempdict = {}  
        for row in csv_reader:  
            tempdict[row[0]] = row[1]   
  return tempdict  
  
  
datafile = "./emailList.csv"  
emailUID = file_to_dict(datafile)
```
In this script we read from a .csv file, loop through its contents, assign emails as keys and mapping UID numbers as their values. If we print the new dictionary's content using ```print(emailUID)``` it will return this:
```
{'ï»¿Email': 'UID', 'test1@gmail.com': '1000000001', 'test2@gmail.com': '1000000002', 'test3@gmail.com': '1000000003', 'test4@gmail.com': '1000000004', 'test5@gmail.com': '1000000005', 'test6@gmail.com': '1000000006', 'test7@gmail.com': '1000000007', 'test8@gmail.com': '1000000008', 'test9@gmail.com': '1000000009', 'test10@gmail.com': '1000000010', 'test11@gmail.com': '1000000011', 'test12@gmail.com': '1000000012', 'test13@gmail.com': '1000000013', 'test14@gmail.com': '1000000014', 'test15@gmail.com': '1000000015', 'test16@gmail.com': '1000000016', 'test17@gmail.com': '1000000017', 'test18@gmail.com': '1000000018', 'test19@gmail.com': '1000000019', 'test20@gmail.com': '1000000020'}
```
So now we know how to create and add keys and values to dictionaries, but what if we add an existing key to a different value? Adding a key that already exists with a different value will *overwrite* the value that the key is currently associated with. This overwrite can be avoided with a simple if-statement.
```
if key not in tempdict.keys():
	tempdict[key] = value
```
Here, ```.keys()``` is a way to return a list of all keys in the dictionary of ```tempdict```. 

Now that we can add to a dictionary and read all keys of a dictionary, what about reading all values? We can access values by doing:
```
# for a single key
print(tempdict[key])

# for all keys
for item in tempdict.keys():  
    print(tempdict[item])
```
