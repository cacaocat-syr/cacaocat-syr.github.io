### Python: Retrieving Data from XML Elements with Specific Attributes

You are tasked to extract StudentID numbers from XML files that have a specific attribute. You open a file only to find out that its a large mess of parent elements. 

We will use ElementTree from the XML module so you will want to import it. Using the ```as``` will make it easier to refer to the ElementTree module.
```
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
```
ElementTree refers to the elements in an XML file as a tree and each element tag is a node in that tree.  Using ET we want to parse the file and set our tree.
```
def get_StudentID(file):
    tree = ET.parse(file)
```
Next we want to get the root element of the file. This refers to the parent element of all elements in the file. 
```
def get_StudentID(file):
    tree = ET.parse(file)
    root = tree.getroot()
```
Next our goal is to get data from elements that have a specific attribute in them. For this example we want to get any ```<StudentID>``` tag with the attribute ```Active=Y``` in the XML file. From the root node of the tree we will want to search and return all occurrences of this using the ```.findall()``` function. ```.findall()``` returns the location in memory of where that XML tag is, but we can still retrieve the data. So we will create a temporary list to store the data of those nodes. 
```
def get_StudentID(file):
    tree = ET.parse(file)
    root = tree.getroot()
	templist = []
    results = root.findall(".//StudentID[@Active='Y']")
    for result in results
		templist.append(result)
    return templist
 ```
With this function we can retrieve data from each file and return them as a list to append to a bigger list of all the data from all files. Concurrency might help speed this up. Refer to one of my previous blogs for this.
