Python: Notes about Some Rserved Words and Terms

- ```IS``` Operator VS ```==```

The IS Operator is used to compare two objects yet so does ==, BUT they do completely different things in Python. 

IS compares by identity. Are they pointing to the same object in memory? Are they the same object? 

== compares by content. Do these two object contain the same content? Are they similar?

Consider the below for example:
```
a = 123
b = 123
c = a

# 
if a is b
	print("a = b")
else
	print("a does not = b")
```


- ```None``` Key 

- ```in``` Operator
